# AGENT.md

## Overview

This document describes the agent component for the `uv-tui` project. The agent is responsible for handling core logic, communication, and orchestration within the application.

## Responsibilities

- Manage communication between the user interface and backend services.
- Process user commands and route them to appropriate handlers.
- Maintain agent state and context.
- Handle errors and provide feedback to the UI.

## Usage

Import and initialize the agent in your main application entry point:

```python
from agent import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.run()
```

## Configuration

Configure the agent using environment variables or a configuration file as needed.

## Extending

To add new capabilities, implement additional handler methods in the agent class and register them in the command routing logic.
